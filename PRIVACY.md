# Privacy Policy for AiKey

**Last updated: February 17, 2026**

AiKey is a Chrome extension that helps developers securely store and manage API keys for AI services such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

## Data Collection

- AiKey does **not** collect, transmit, or sell any personal information.
- AiKey does **not** send any data to external servers controlled by AiKey Labs or third parties.
- All data used by the extension is stored locally in your browser.

## Permissions

AiKey uses the following Chrome extension permissions:

### `storage`
- Used only to store your AI API keys and extension settings locally in `chrome.storage`.
- This allows AiKey to remember your configuration between browser sessions.
- The data stored with this permission never leaves your device and is not shared with AiKey Labs.

AiKey does **not** use any remote code execution or remotely hosted JavaScript.

## Cookies and Tracking

- AiKey does not use cookies.
- AiKey does not track your browsing history, clicks, or user activity.
- AiKey does not use any analytics or advertising services.

## Third-Party Services

AiKey does not communicate with any external backend services operated by AiKey Labs.  
API keys you configure in AiKey are used only by you in your own tools and are not transmitted by AiKey to any server.

## Data Security

Because all data is stored locally in your browser, you are responsible for:
- Securing access to your computer and browser profile.
- Removing your data by uninstalling the extension or clearing the extension’s storage.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published at this URL. Your continued use of AiKey after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
