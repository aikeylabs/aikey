# AiKey Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2026-02-19_

AiKey is a browser extension that helps developers manage and fill their API keys more easily.  
We take your privacy and the security of your keys seriously.

## What data we store

- API keys and related labels that you choose to save in AiKey.
- Basic configuration data (such as profiles, tags and preferences).

All of the above data is stored **locally in your browser**.  
AiKey does **not** send your API keys to our servers.

## What data we collect

In the current version, AiKey does **not** collect or send any personally identifiable information to our servers.  
We may add optional, anonymous usage metrics in the future (such as feature usage counts), and will update this document before enabling them.

## Third‑party services

Your API keys are used only to call the AI/model providers that you configure (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).  
AiKey does not share your keys with any other third parties.
